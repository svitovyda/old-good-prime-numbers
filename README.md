# Old good prime numbers
## Few experiments inspired by Coursera "Parallel programming" course

Just wanted to try some ideas of optimyzing prime numbers algorithms, didn't intended to implement the quickest one.

`PrimesListTillLimit` - get all primes till the limit.
Speedup with sequential is ~18-24 times, the bigger limit is - the bigger difference. Passing initial primes `(3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)` affects performance significally.
