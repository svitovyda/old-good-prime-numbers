# Old good prime numbers
## Few experiments inspired by Coursera "Parallel programming" course

Just wanted to try some ideas of paralleling different algorithms using prime numbers search as example.
Implemented different ideas, not always efficient, to play with correct paralleling and different collections.

`PrimesListTillLimit` - get all primes till the limit.

`PrimeAtNPlaceRunner` - get the N-th prime number.

`Sieve` - implementations of sieving (of mostly mutable collections) instead of checking each element by % operator
